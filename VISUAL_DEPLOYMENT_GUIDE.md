3. Click **"Add PostgreSQL"**
4. Wait 2 minutes for setup

**What this does:** Creates a place for your app to remember users, videos, and clips

**Required Keys:**
- **Name:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` **Value:** `sk-your-key-from-openai`

## Step 7: Wait for Your App to Build

2. **You should see:** "AutoClipper AI is running"
3. **Test these pages:**
   - Add `/health` to your URL - should show "healthy"
   - Add `/api/status` to your URL - should show "online"

**If it works:** Congratulations! Your app is live on the internet! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸš¨ If Something Goes Wrong
