# AutoClipper AI - WHOP Video Clipper + AI Video Editor + Auto Publisher

## Overview

AutoClipper AI is a SaaS platform that automates the process of creating and publishing short-form video content from WHOP course videos. The system logs into users' WHOP accounts, extracts video content, uses AI to identify clip-worthy moments, edits those clips with captions and branding, and automatically publishes them to social media platforms.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React.js (primary choice) or Next.js for server-side rendering needs
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI for modern, lightweight UI components
- **Authentication UI**: Firebase Auth UI SDK or Supabase Auth integration
- **Deployment**: Replit's web environment with custom domain mapping

### Backend Architecture
- **Language**: Python with FastAPI or Node.js with Express (both supported on Replit)
- **Job Scheduling**: Python Celery + Redis or Replit's Tasks API for automation workflows
- **API Communication**: Axios (Node.js) or httpx (Python) for external API calls

### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (preferred) or Firebase Firestore
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage, Supabase Storage, or AWS S3 for video files
- **User Data**: Authentication provider's built-in user management

## Key Components

### 1. Authentication & Licensing System
