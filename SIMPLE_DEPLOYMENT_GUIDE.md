1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign up for free (if you don't have an account)
2. **Click the green "New" button** to create a new repository
3. **Name it:** `autoclipper-ai`

Your app needs a database to store information.

1. **In your Railway project, click "New Service"**
2. **Select "PostgreSQL"**
3. **Click "Add PostgreSQL"**
4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for setup to complete

Your app needs special keys to work with other services.

2. **Go to "Variables" tab**
3. **Add these one by one:**

**Required Keys:**
- Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY` Value: `sk-your-openai-key-here`
- Name: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` Value: `sk_your-stripe-key-here`
- Name: `NODE_ENV` Value: `production`

**How to get these keys:**
- **OpenAI Key:** Go to platform.openai.com â†’ API Keys â†’ Create new key
- **Stripe Key:** Go to dashboard.stripe.com â†’ Developers â†’ API Keys â†’ Copy secret key

## Step 6: Deploy Your App

1. **Railway will automatically start building** your app
2. **Watch the "Deployments" tab** - you'll see progress
3. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for the build to complete
4. **Look for "Success" message**

## Step 7: Get Your Live Website

1. **In Railway, go to "Settings" tab**
2. **Click "Generate Domain"**
3. **Copy your new website URL** (looks like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)

## Step 8: Test Your Website

1. **Visit your new website URL**
2. **You should see:** "AutoClipper AI is running" or similar
3. **Test these pages:**
   - `your-url.com/health` - Should show "healthy"
   - `your-url.com/api/status` - Should show "online"

## That's It! ðŸŽ‰

Your AutoClipper AI is now live on the internet. Anyone can visit your website URL and use your app.

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Solution:** Check that you uploaded all files from Replit correctly

**Problem:** "App won't start"
**Solution:** Make sure you added the OpenAI API key in Step 5

**Problem:** "Can't connect to database"
**Solution:** The PostgreSQL database takes a few minutes to start - wait and try again
